# MLH Coding Challenge

Coding challenge submission made by Simon Stroh.

## Steps

  ### Setup
  - The setup for my project was an HTML file and a CSS file, as well as a folder where I would store all of my assets, such as images or icons.
  Marking Up First Draft
  - In my HTML file, I created the structure for my document, following the format of the layout in the example given, replacing the placeholder text with information about myself.
  ### Creating the Structure
  The page was divided into three modules:
  - the navbar
  - the profile picture
  - the biography
  ### Designing the Layout
  - Once I completed the structure of my webpage, I proceeded to view the document in a browser so I could get a sense of what my initial changes looked like.
  - I opened the page from my local machine and viewed the position of all of my elements. This was a good starting point because I can adjust the position and size of each of the elements based on their proportions and based on their position.
  - I moved the items into the correct position and began adjusting the heights and widths of each of my elements. I selected the right fonts to use and applied the fonts to different parts of the page.
  - With all of my elements correctly positioned, sized, and my colors and fonts selected carefully, I created my GitHub repository and turned it into a GitHub page.
